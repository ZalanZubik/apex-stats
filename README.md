## About

Statfinder is a stats tracker for Apex Legends, which is a free-to-play battle royale game. The game is available on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

The website got its name after Pathfinder, one of the legends in the game, who is a forward scout. He can scan survey beacons to reveal the ringâ€™s next location using the Insider Knowledge ability. Statfinder also uses this skill to show you any player's statistics (lifetime and legend stats) on all platforms. There are leaderboards available as well to check the top players.

Tracker Network API provides stats, global and regional leaderboards and much more to gamers around the world. It supports many games, not just Apex Legends.

The website is hosted by Netlify. [Check here!](https://statfinder.netlify.com/)
